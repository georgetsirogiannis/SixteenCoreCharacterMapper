# 16Core Character Mapper - Help Documentation

## Introduction
Welcome to **16Core Character Mapper** — a dedicated tool for writers, game designers, and storytellers to visualize and organize character personalities. By mapping your cast across 16 core personality traits, you can ensure consistency, spark narrative tension, and avoid "cloned" characters.

## Getting Started

### Launching the Application
When you open the app you'll see three main areas:
1.  **Toolbar** (top) — project and tool buttons.
2.  **Character Panel** (left) — add, select and manage characters.
3.  **Traits Grid** (right) — where each character is shown on the personality map.

## Managing Characters

### Adding & Editing Characters
Click **Add** to create a new character or **Edit** (or double-click) to modify an existing one.
* **Name:** What you call the character.
* **Color:** The specific color for their bubble on the Traits Grid.
* **Role:** Determines the size of the character's bubble:
    * **Main:** Large bubble (Protagonists/Antagonists).
    * **Supporting:** Medium bubble.
    * **Background:** Small bubble.
* In this dialog, you can also take the built-in questionnairre (more below).

### Organization Features
* **Drag and Drop:** Reorder characters within their Role groups (Main, Supporting, Background).
* **Visibility (Eye Icon):** Hide characters to focus on specific relationships or sub-groups.
* **Locking (Lock Icon):** Protect a character’s position on the grid from accidental changes.
* **Deletion:** Remove a character permanently from the project.

## Mapping Personalities
The Traits Grid is inspired by established psychological frameworks, using public domain terminology (IPIP) to help you define character dispositions.

The right-hand Traits Grid shows one card for each trait and a bubble for each visible character.
* **Bubbles** — colored bubbles represent characters.
* **Position** — horizontal placement reflects the character’s leaning on that trait.
* **Size** — bubble size reflects the character’s role (Main, Supporting, Background).
* **High and Low Labels** — each trait card contains descriptions of the two opposing poles of that trait at the left and right ends. The labels help you understand what each side means. Your character doesn't have to match the label exactly — they can be anywhere along the spectrum.
* **Notes** — click the Note icon in the top-right of a trait card to add notes about that trait. Use them to record specific story beats, examples of how a character manifests a trait, reminders about why a character sits at a certain point on the scale, or story ideas related to that trait. Your notes are saved automatically with your project.

### 1. Manual Mapping
Simply drag a character’s bubble horizontally across any trait card.

Remember, your character can sit anywhere along the spectrum, not just at the extremes. Where the program actually shines is when you start comparing multiple characters side-by-side, deciding who is "more" or "less" of a trait relative to others.

### 2. The Questionnaire
If a character is still forming in your head or you want a science-backed starting point, use the built-in questionnaire inside the **Edit Character** dialog.

* **Accessing the Tool:**
    * Click **Take Questionnaire** if no answers are saved for this character.
    * After you answer for the first time, the button becomes **Edit Questionnaire** to refine previously saved answers.
* **How it Works:**
    * The questionnaire asks short, grouped questions. Your answers are converted into scores that automatically place the character on the grid. 
    * **Precision:** Try to answer as many questions as possible; more answers result in a more precise placement. 
    * **Neutral Answers:** If you leave some questions blank within a scored section, the app treats them as **Neutral** (middle-of-the-road) answers.
* **Excluding Traits:** If a specific trait section doesn't apply to your character or you don't want to deal with it right now, uncheck the **"Use these answers to calculate position" checkbox** at the top of that section. The app will skip scoring for that trait entirely.
* **Refinement & Hybrid Use:**  You can skip sections or submit early; the app updates only the sections you included.
    * **Partial Updates:** When you re-run the questionnaire, only the sections with new answers will update the map positions. This allows you to keep manual positions for some traits while letting the questionnaire handle others.

## Exporting & Sharing
* **Export Image:** Save the current Traits Grid as a PNG image. You can choose to include all characters, specific groups, or specific characters.
* **Export Notes:** Creates a TXT file containing all trait notes from your project, grouped and labeled for easy reference during your writing process.

---

## Settings
*   **Toggle Theme** — switch between Light and Dark mode to match your workspace.
*   **Language** — choose from English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Polish, and Greek. The parts translated are the Traits Grid (trait names, descriptions, labels) and the Questionnaire (questions and group titles). Some UI labels and dialogs may stay in the original language.
*   **Updates** — the app checks for updates on startup and will let you know if a new version is available.
